  words: view all previously entered words:
  end: end turn

  Remember all words you are entering into the game must be prefaced with the command "word" 
  and a space in the format "word ******"

Once everybody is done, you are in the endgame and have the following commands
  score: view score and other stats from this round
  rematch: start a new game with a new board, but the smae players and score 
  words: view all possible words from this round
