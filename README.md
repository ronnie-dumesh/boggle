# boggle
A game of Boggle, the word game, implemented in OCaml as part of the open-ended final project for Cornell's CS3110. The game can be played running "make play" in the command line on a system with OCaml installed.

Boggle "is played using a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters." A full list of rules can be accessed in-game

This game makes use of advanced software design principles emphasized in CS3110 such as modularity, abstraction, and unit testing.

The game also makes use of advanced functional programming features such as pattern-matching and tail-recursion.

A video of gameplay with all features demonstrated can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zoCLJR4d18rMaWO6j_UEOYgyF8dMw0lW)
